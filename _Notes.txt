When you use this template, there is just a few things you must do to
make it work with another table.

A) A reference must be made to the correct DAO object library depending
   on the type of Access database you use.


B) First, you must go in the form's declaration section and change the
   constant mcstrDBName to set it to your database name.
   
   Second, you must change the constant mcstrSQL to set it to your
   SQL string.
   
	 Example:
	 --------
	 ' The db the form will use.
	 Private Const mcstrDBName As String = "\DB.mdb"
		
	 ' The SQL the form will use.
	 Private Const mcstrSQL = "SELECT tblClans.CL_ID, tblClans.CL_Name, " & _
		                        "tblClans.CL_Year, tblClans.CL_Note " & _
		                        "FROM tblClans;"


C) For each field in the table that you want to diplay in the form, you must
   create a text control on the form and put the folowing in the tag property
   of the control (separated by ;)

   IsField        ' Insert the text "Field" to indicate it's a field anything
	                ' else won't be considered as a field. Usefull if we want to
	                ' use the tag property for other controls.
	 FieldName      ' The name of the field in the table
	 FieldValue     ' The value that will be saved in FieldName
	 FieldType      ' The type of field Alpha or Num
	 FieldDup       ' Are dups allowed (AllowDup) or no (NoDup)
	 DefaultValue   ' The default value if any
	 FieldUserName  ' The name that the users sees on the form
	 NullsPermited  ' Are nulls permited for this field (AllowNull) or (NoNull)
	 NavDesc        ' The description that will show on the txtNavDesc control.

	 Example:
	 --------
	 txtClan: Field;CL_Name;CL_Name;Alpha;NoDup;;Name;NoNull;Clan Name;
	 
	 txtYear: Field;CL_Year;CL_Year;Num;DupAllowed;0;Year;AllowNull;_
	          The first year in wich this Clan can be used. Use 0 if _
	          always available.;
	    
	 txtNote: Field;CL_Note;CL_Note;Alpha;DupAllowed;;Note;AllowNull;_
	          Note on this Clan.;
